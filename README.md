## NYC Coffee Shop Comparison
Project 3

## Project Goals:
The goal of the present project is to generate a website that allows for the comparison of coffee shop chains in New York City. Specifically, we aim to examine the price point and ratings of the top 5 coffee shop chains, and aim to discover how the remaining 4 differ from corporate giant Starbucks on those metrics.

Our specific data questions include:
1. Is there a connection between price point and ratings of the 5 largest coffee shop chains in New York City?
2. How do the other larger chains compare to Starbucks in terms of rating and price point?

## Data Sources Files:
This data was collected from the Yelp API. Specifically, we examined the following 5 coffee chains:
- Starbucks
- Think Coffee
- Birch Coffee
- Joe Coffee
- Gregory's Coffee

## Data Extraction & Cleaning:

## Products Developed:
The following products were developed for the web page:

and reviews. 
- A bar Chart for price point comparisons among 5 coffee chains.
